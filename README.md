This application is a demonstration of how to prevent an Android Fragment from rotating when all other fragments in the activity are permitted to rotate (or vice versa).

The application that I use as the basis of the demonstration is from here: http://www.androidhive.info/2013/11/android-sliding-menu-using-navigation-drawer/

The blog post explaining this code can be found at http://www.peteonsoftware.com/index.php/2014/03/07/dynamically-preventing-rotation-on-an-android-fragment/
